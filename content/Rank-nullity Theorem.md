# Rank-nullity Theorem

## Definition

> [!axiom]+
> For any $n \times m$ matrix $A$, the rank-nullity theorem states that the sum of the rank of $A$ and the dimension of the null space of $A$ is equal to the number of columns of $A$. Mathematically, this can be written as:
> $$\text{dim}(\text{ker }A) + \text{dim}(\text{im} A) = m$$

> [!definition]
> The **rank** of a matrix $A$ is the dimension of the column space of $A$, denoted by $\text{rank}(A)$.
> 


> [!definition]
> The **nullity** of a matrix $A$ is the dimension of the null space of $A$, denoted by $\text{nullity}(A)$.
