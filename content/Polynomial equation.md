# Polynomial equation


> [!theorem] Root of Polynomial
> Let $p(x)$ be a polynomial of degree $n$ with complex coefficients. Then, $p(x)$ has at $n$ roots in the complex plane (counting the multiple roots)
> 

> [!definition] Multiplicity of $z_0$
> When $p(z) = (z-z_0)^m q(z)$ where $q(z)$ is a polynomial that does not have $z_0$ as a root. The multiplicity of $z_0$ is $m$.
